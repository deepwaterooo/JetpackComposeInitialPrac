* Android Compose
- Have been exposed to Kotlin a couple of years ago, had learned
  languagel fundamentals, but have not really practices a lot...
- Now finally I am exposed to this Jetpack Compose, and absolutely like it
- By following this tutorial and tried to type some code using Android
  Studio ide, I finally understand why nowadays, ide emacs keybindings
  plugins are so popular...I have to get used to IDE emacs keybinding
  programming too (now feels very wired typing in IDE...)
- will get more practices on JetPack Compose......, and more practices
  on Kotlin programming
